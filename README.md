# Base94r
A little program I made for converting between base94r and numbers/strings.

## Why is it called Base94r?

Well it's called Base94 because that's literally what it is. Base 94. However, the r at the end is the inital of my first name, signifying that it is my version of Base 94, and my version of how I implemented it. 

## What is Base94r?

Base94r is base94, with each number 1-94 being represented by a character. I did it based on the increasing number of the values of the ASCII characters.
